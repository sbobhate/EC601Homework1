# Description

For this homework we created a simple application that uses _color-based segmentation_ in the _HSV_ color-space. One can change the upper and lower thresholds to extract a certain color. We highlight the contours of the detected object. We used an open-source c# wrapper for OpenCV called _EmguCV_. We used C# since it allowed us to create a windows form application. We also added functionality to save the result.

# Installation

The installation files folder contains a setup.exe. This can be used to install and run the application on a Windows machine without Visual Studio.

# Images

We have included a screenshot of the trello board.
We have also included screenshots of the results of tracking a blue, green and red object.
